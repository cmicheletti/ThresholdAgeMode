Supporting information for the paper *On the relationship between life expectancy, modal age at death, and the threshold age of the life table entropy* by Chiara MICHELETTI and Francisco VILLAVICENCIO, published in Demographic Research as part of the special collection in memory James W. Vaupel.

This repository contains the following files and folders:
* ThresholdAgeMode.R: R code to reproduce all the results and figures from the paper.
* Functions.R: file with all the necessary functions to reproduce the results and figures from the paper. The file is sourced by ThresholdAgeMode.R and does not need to be executed by the user.
* The Data folder with
  	- HMD Life tables of England and Wales, Italy, Japan, Spain, Sweden and the United States, for females from the earliest available year since 1900 to 2021. The data is automatically uploaded when executing the R-script ThresholdAgeMode.R;
	- the Density_plots.Rdata file, a dataset containing the necessary information to reproduce Figure 5 and Figure A-1. The dataset is derived from 8022 HMD life tables and is provided here in its final form to avoid the upload of large data files.
